U.P. has always held a high political significance in Indian\\ndemocracy because it’s home to the \\nlargest share of Indian population\\n and it portrays\\ndynamic social demographics too. U.P. was created in the year 1937 by the British regime\\nunder the name of United Provinces and post independence it was renamed as Uttar\\n2/41pradesh in 1950. \\nLucknow\\n district serves as the capital of U.P.. A total of \\n18 divisions and\\n75 districts\\n constitute this state, whose northern portion was carved out in the year 2000 to\\nform Uttarakhand, the 27\\n state of India. Agriculture is the primary contributor in the\\neconomy of the state and it’s also known as the \\nRice bowl of India\\n.\\nState feature \\nhighly rugged terrain\\n and their \\nelevation ranges from 300 to 5000\\nmts\\n.\\nThe Siwalik range in U.P. plummets down to the \\nBhabhar area,\\n which is a \\nporous bed\\nof coarse pebbles and boulders\\n brought down by the rivers flowing down the Siwalik\\nhills.\\nThe river-streams tend to sink in these porous beds of sediments.\\nBhabhar tract lies along the periphery of Siwalik foothills and it transitions into the\\nTerai region gradually.\\nThis transition belt is termed \\n‘Terai and Bhabhar area’\\n and it is marked by \\nrich\\nforests and various riverstreams\\n. \\nGEOGRAPHY\\nLocation and Landform (Physiography)\\nUttar Pradesh is situated between \\n23°52’N and 31°28’N latitudes\\n and \\n77°3′ and\\n84°39’E longitudes\\n.\\nIt shares its \\nnational boundaries\\n with \\n9 other states\\n i.e., Himachal Pradesh, Delhi,\\nHaryana on the north west; Uttarakhand in the north; Rajasthan touches U.P. from the\\nwest; Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on the south; Jharkhand to the south-east &\\nBihar lies in its east.\\nInternationally U.P. is \\nlandlocked by Nepal\\n on the north. With an area of \\n29.4 m ha\\n it\\nis the \\nfourth largest state\\n in Indian subcontinent.\\nIt is also the \\nmost populous State\\n.\\nGeomorphologically Uttar Pradesh can be divided into \\n3 major topographical regions\\n:\\n1\\n. \\nSiwalik foothills of Himalayas and the Terai region\\n border U.P. on the north.\\n2\\n. \\nGangetic plains\\n constitute the major central portion of the state.\\n3\\n. \\nVindhya Range and plateau\\n lie in a relatively smaller part of southern U.P.\\nSiwalik Hills and Terai Region\\nSiwalik Range forms the \\nsouthern foothills of the Himalayas\\n which border U.P. on\\nthe north.\\nth\\n3/41The \\nlowland\\n area dispersed with \\nmarshes, thick forests, swamps rich in clay and\\ntall grasslands\\n that runs parallel to the bhabhar tract is called \\nTerai region\\n. This area\\nis composed of \\nfine alluvium\\n primarily sand, clay, silt and gravel.\\nAs the rivers flow down the slopes of Bhabhar and course through the relatively\\nplanar areas of Terai the sediments are deposited in shallow beds, and the sunken\\nriver streams of Bhabhar reemerge on the surface, causing \\nmassive floods\\n.\\nWidth of Bhabhar — 8-16 km\\nWidth of Terai — 15-30 km\\nGangetic Plains\\nGangetic plains are characterised by a \\nflat topography and highly fertile alluvial\\nsoil\\n.\\nThe two-river system called Ganges which includes \\nGanga and Yamuna and their\\ntributaries,\\n that flow down the Himalayas, is responsible for laying in alluvial deposits\\nwhich make the soil of Gangetic plains highly fertile and suitable for growing crops like\\nrice, wheat, barley, gram\\n etc.\\nThese plains span about \\nthree-fourths of the total area of the state,\\n stretching\\nfrom east to west and covering most of its central portion.\\nIts flat topography comprises of several physical features like \\nrivers, lakes, ponds,\\nelevation ranging from 60 mts in the east to 300 mts in the north-west and a\\ngradient of 2 m/sq km\\n.\\nThe Gangetic plains are constituted by the Ganga-Yamuna Doab, the Ganges plains,\\nTerai and the Ghaghra plains; and this entire expanse of alluvial terrain is divided into\\nthree sub-regions\\n:\\nEastern tract: \\nThe eastern tract of Gangetic plains is classified as scarcity region\\nas it is often afflicted with famines and floods, and the agricultural lands of this\\nregion don’t receive adequate irrigation. A total of 14 districts fall under this\\ntract.\\nCentral tract:\\n It is a well irrigated tract but suffers from water logging.\\nWestern tract:\\n This zone is well developed in terms of Agriculture because of\\nexcellent water resources and irrigation systems.\\nVindhya Range And Plateau Region\\nVindhyas are a \\ndiscontinuous range of hills and mountains\\n.\\nThe southernmost stratum of Gangetic plains in U.P. is rendered by \\nhard and varied\\ntopography of hills, highlands and plateaus\\n.\\nWith an \\naverage elevation of 300 mts,\\n this is a \\nlow-lying range\\n that receives \\nsparse\\nrains\\n and is \\ndevoid of adequate water resources,\\n thus farmers in this region resort\\nto \\ndry-farming\\n.\\n4/41Following \\n4 divisions\\n fall under the canopy of this region:\\nBundelkhand plateau – \\nJhansi, Jalaun, Banda, Hamirpur\\nTehsils of Allahabad\\n district\\nMirzapur\\n district\\nChakia Tehsil of Varanasi\\n district\\nWATER RESOURCES (HYDROGEOLOGY)\\nMajor Source of Surface Water:\\n \\nGanges\\n and its tributaries flowing from northwest to the\\nsoutheast direction.\\nBasin:\\n \\nGanga sub-basin\\n of Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna Basin\\nMajor Rivers:\\n Ganges, Yamuna, Ghagra, Gomti, Gandak, Son, Kosi, Sarda,etc\\nHydrogeological units:\\n 1.

The Aryans, through conquests occupied the\\nadjoining areas too.\\n14/41Aryans\\n laid the foundations of their civilisation in the region. It was during the Aryan\\ninhabitation in the region that epics of \\nMahabharata, Ramayana, Brahmanas\\n and\\nPuranas\\n were written.\\nThe state is the heart of Mahabharata war. The \\nKosala Kingdom of Ayodhya\\n is said to\\nhave been incarnated in the city of \\nMathura\\n.\\nIt was around the middle of the 1\\n millennium BC that Uttar Pradesh saw the advent\\nof \\nLord Buddha\\n and the spread of Buddhism. Around the time Lord Buddha delivered\\nhis first sermon at \\nDhamek Stupa in Sarnath\\n when Uttar Pradesh was under the\\nMagadh rule\\n. Here \\nChaukhandi Stupa\\n marks the spot where Lord Buddha met his\\ndisciples.\\nBesides \\nKuru, Panchalas, Vatsas\\n and \\nVidehas\\n etc. formed the early region of the\\nstate. These regions were known as \\nMadhyadesa\\n. During \\nAshoka`s reign,\\n several\\npublic welfare works were taken up.
